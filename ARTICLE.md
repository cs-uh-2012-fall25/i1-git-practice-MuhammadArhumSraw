The article analyses the way software engineers adapt to the new AI tools like GitHub Copilot, which reshape how the code is being written.
In the begaining, many programmers responded with fear and scepticism, concerned about being replaced or having their skills devalued.
However, as they experimented with Copilot, their perspective shifted, and excitement grew as they discovered its potential to automate repetitive coding tasks, fixing minor bugs, and having time for more creative and complex work.
This emotional journeyâ€”from anxiety to appreciation illustrates a broader pattern that applies across professions, as AI becomes an integral part of daily workflows in fields such as medicine, law, and accounting. Rather than viewing AI as a replacement, the article encourages seeing it as a collaborator that enhances human skills. For employers, this means acknowledging the emotional side of technological change and supporting workers through phased introductions, training, and communication. Ultimately, the article argues that the future of work lies not in competition between humans and machines, but in collaboration, where AI enhances productivity, creativity, and continuous learning.
